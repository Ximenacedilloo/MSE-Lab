 * 2. Enables the clock for TIM2

 * @note This function must be called before using timer_delay_ms()
 * 
 * @warning Calling this function multiple times has no effect after

/**
 * @brief Generates a blocking delay in milliseconds
 * 
 * This function creates an accurate delay using TIM2 hardware timer.
 * The delay is implemented as follows:
 * 1. Configure TIM2 to generate an update event after DELAY_MS milliseconds
 * 2. Enable the timer to start counting
 * 3. Wait (block) until the timer reaches the configured value
 * 4. Disable the timer to save power
 * 
 * @pre timer_init() must be called before this function
 * 
 * @note The function is blocking - CPU waits for the entire delay duration
 * @note Default delay is 1000ms (1 second) as defined by DELAY_MS
 * 
 * @warning Do not call this function from an interrupt handler as it blocks
 * 
 * @return No return value
