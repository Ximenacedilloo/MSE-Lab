 * in milliseconds.
 * 
 * The module allows initialization and generation of delays without
 * occupying the CPU with software loops.

/**
 * @brief Generates a blocking delay in milliseconds
 * 
 * This function creates a delay by configuring TIM2 for the specified
 * amount of time, then waiting for the timer to complete its cycle.
 * The function blocks execution until the delay time has elapsed.
 * 
 * @pre timer_init() must be called before this function
 * @post Delay has been executed (program waits for specified time)
 * 
 * @return No return value
 * 
 * @note The delay is implemented using hardware timer polling,
 *       which is more accurate than software loops
